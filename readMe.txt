Install nodejs settings unless you have it installed already
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

from the command line run "npm install http-server -g"
from the command line, while inside this project directory, run "http-server"

other methods for hosting this directory are fine, this is just provided to be fast an easy in case you don't have another prefered method on hand.
